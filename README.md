# Android-Feature-Editing

The Application uses ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android 100.2.1.

Documentation refered:
https://developers.arcgis.com/android/latest/guide/edit-features.htm

Description:
Three steps involved in editing and commiting changes to the feature service:

1. Create a service feature table from a feature service using the REST endpoint (URL, in other words) 
   to identify the features you want to work with, or open a map which already contains a
   service feature table via a feature layer.
2. Perform any edits against the service feature table (add, update, and delete features and feature attachments).
3. Apply your edits to the feature service right away.
